Testing with Partially Broken Connectivity](https://philsbln.github.io/ipv6-app-testing/draft-tiesel-v6ops-ipv6-app-testing.html#name-testing-with-partially-brok) or [5.2 Destination Address Selection Preference and Address Filtering](https://philsbln.github.io/ipv6-app-testing/draft-tiesel-v6ops-ipv6-app-testing.html#name-destination-address-selecti)?\n",

For example, in FreeBSD there is an option to assign IPv4 and IPv6 stacks in a jail and when operating in an IPv6-only environment you don't want to assign the IPv4 stack. For many basic services we use (for example, BIND or Nginx) we must change the default configuration to replace 127.0.0.1 with ::1 to make them work.",
